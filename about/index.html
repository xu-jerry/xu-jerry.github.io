            Hi there! My legal name is Chujun Xu, but I usually go by Jerry since it's a lot easier for non-Chinese people to pronounce. I'm currently a second year CS major studying at UCLA's Samueli School of Engineering, hoping to add a math double major sooner rather than later.

            I went to Piedmont Hills High School, in north San Jose, so I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley. I've always loved math, computer science, and puzzles/brain teasers in general. Some of my hobbies include running cross-country, playing music (piano, flute, and a little bit of piccolo if you were curious), and playing mobile games. Of course, an introduction wouldn't be complete without mentioning that I love eating food, both a lot of and good. :) If you ever wanted to chat, feel free to email, message me on Facebook/Discord/Instagram, and I'd be happy to make a new friend!
