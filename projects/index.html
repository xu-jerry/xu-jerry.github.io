<p>
    Here are a couple of my projects.
</p>
<h2>
    COSMOS Website
</h2>
<p>
    <a href = https://sites.google.com/site/jerryxucosmoscluster6/home>This</a> is a website that I created back in the summer between my 
    sophomore and junior year in high school, during my four week long summer camp. California State Summer School for Mathematics & Science 
    (COSMOS) is a residential summer camp aimed at exploring STEM topics with college faculty, beyond what high school covers. I was in Cluster 
    6, which included 2 classes: Computer Networking and Robotics.
