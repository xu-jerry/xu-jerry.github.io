<p>
    Here are a couple of my projects that I am proud of:
</p>

<h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/xu-jerry/trafficlight-project">Traffic Light Project</a>
</h2>
<p>
    During senior year of high school, I used the Bosch dataset to create a Computer Vision project. The project was comprised of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that takes an image of a car's dashcam with the coordinates of traffic light(s) in the image as input, and outputs whether each light was red, green or yellow.

    <a href = https://sites.google.com/site/jerryxucosmoscluster6/home>COSMOS Website</a>
</h2>
<p>
    <a href = https://sites.google.com/site/jerryxucosmoscluster6/home>This</a> was a website that I created back in the summer between my 
    sophomore and junior year in high school, during my four week long summer camp. California State Summer School for Mathematics & Science 
    (COSMOS) is a residential summer camp aimed at exploring STEM topics with college faculty, beyond what high school covers. I was in Cluster 
    6, which included 2 classes: Computer Networking and Robotics.

    <a href = https://issuu.com/jerryxud12e/docs/distinguished_secretary> Distinguished Secretary </a>
</h2>
<p>
    At Piedmont Hills High School, I participated in Key Club throughout all four years. At the end sophomore year, I took the jump to running for and attaining the position of secretary. For the entirety of junior year, I was hard at work making our school's Key Club a better club overall, culminating in my <a href = https://issuu.com/jerryxud12e/docs/distinguished_secretary>personal online portfolio</a> for <a href = ./Distinguished-Secretary.png> distinguished secretary</a>. At California-Nevada-Hawaii District Convention (CNH DCON) 2019, I received the award, given to only roughly 10 secretaries out of the three states. I used Google Slides to build this.
