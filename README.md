## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/xu-jerry/xu-jerry.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/xu-jerry/xu-jerry.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Personal Website

This my personal website, where I'll be putting my portfolio of projects and any other bits and pieces of my life! Feel free to look around, and check back for new changes.

This was created with Github Pages, Jekyll, and my expertise in Googling. Most of the beginning template was created using this guide: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

To run this website locally, make sure you have cloned the repository, downloaded Ruby, and installed Jekyll. Navigate into the folder with the repo and run this command:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Afterwards, if you go to any browser and type in `localhost:4000`, the website should appear in all its glory!
