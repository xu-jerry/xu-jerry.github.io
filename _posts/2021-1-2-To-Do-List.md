New Year, new me! 

... is an overused cliche that I now say unironically. It's been said over and over again than 2020 was one of the worst years on record. With this new year however, I'm looking forward to many different aspects of my life changing, one of which is perfecting this website. Even though I only started on this project this Christmas break, I have a lot of plans on making it better and better. As of right now, 1/2/21, it is merely the bare bones of a functional static site, so there is much work to do. Here is a list of items I would like to have on my website:

- Add projects such as my traffic light project
- Add a more detailed description in the about page
- Add photos? if/when I have better ones since the only photos I can take are mirror selfies right now
- Add blog posts hopefully once a month on various topics
- Change the CSS to make the website a lot more visually appealing
- Add my resume
- Add animations and cool things like typing effects
- Possibly encode secrets?? ;)
- Research/stalk other personal websites to learn from the pros

Of course, this is not an extensive list, but those are the main things I want to focus on for near future, to get this site to the porfolio I want it to be. Here's to a better 2021!
